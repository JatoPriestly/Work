# Project Understanding and Next Steps

## Project Overview
This project is a Next.js application focused on employee management and QR code functionalities. It utilizes TypeScript for type safety and modular design.

## Key Components
- **Employee Management**: 
  - Located in `app/employee/`
  - Contains layout and page components for employee-related functionalities.
  
- **QR Code Functionality**: 
  - Components like `qr-code-display.tsx` and `qr-scanner.tsx` handle QR code scanning and display.

- **UI Components**: 
  - A variety of reusable UI components are organized under `components/ui/`.

- **API Routes**: 
  - API routes for QR validation and user sign-in are located in `app/api/`.

## Next Steps
1. **Explore Specific Components**: 
   - Review the implementation of key components such as `qr-scanner.tsx` and `employee/page.tsx` to understand their functionality.

2. **Check API Endpoints**: 
   - Investigate the API routes in `app/api/` to understand how they interact with the frontend.

3. **Review State Management**: 
   - Look into how state is managed across the application, especially in components that handle user interactions.

4. **Testing**: 
   - Review the tests in the `tests/` directory to ensure coverage for critical functionalities.

5. **Documentation**: 
   - Update the README.md with insights gained from this exploration.
